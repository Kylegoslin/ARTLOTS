# ARTLOTS Standard - Version 1.0
ARTLOTS - Advanced Resource Tagging for Learners On The Spectrum


## Abstract
ARTLOTS is a JSON based file structure for tagging learning resources with additional metadata
to classify learning resources for learners on the autism spectrum.

Unlike traditional learning resource tagging approaches, a focus is placed on the attributes of a learner on the autism spectrum.
This standard is designed to outine the required JSON attributes for tagging a learning resource for sharing over the Internet.
