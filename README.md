# ARTLOTS Standard - Version 1.0
ARTLOTS - Advanced Resource Tagging for Learners On The Spectrum


## Abstract
ARTLOTS is a JSON based file structure for tagging learning resources with additional metadata
to classify software-based learning resource content and provide a common structure to resources for learners on the autism spectrum.

The core aim of this standard is to provide a baseline for interoperability of learning resources for learners
on the autism spectrum.

This standard is a component of the OpenEARL.org project.

## Developed by

## 1. Introduction
The ARTLOTS standard is designed to be a common standard for resource exchange and integration for learning
applications used by learners on the autism spectrum. Emphasis is placed on the attributes of an autistic learner which
are often overlooked by other resource tagging approaches.

The core standard can be broken into three components:

1. Learner Profile Metadata (Section 2).
3. Learning Resource Tagging Metadata (Section 3).
3. Learning Resource Scene Structures (Section 4).
